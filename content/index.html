    <h2>Python is a programming language.</h2>
    <p>It's used all over the world by all sorts of people, from professional
    coders to complete beginners. It's very easy to learn. Use Python to
    code cool stuff on your micro:bit, Raspberry Pi or other computing
    device.</p>

            <h2>micro:bit</h2>
            <p>The BBC micro:bit is a small programmable device. The aim is to
            inspire a new generation of digital creators, makers and coders.
            Thanks to the amazing
            <a href="http://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a> project, it runs
            a full re-implementation of Python 3.</p>
            <p>The device consists of two buttons, a 5x5 LED matrix, I/O pins,
            an accelerometer, compass, radio, micro-USB port, battery connector
            and ARM microprocessor.</p>

            <h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>
            <p>The Raspberry Pi is a unique phenomenon. It is the most
            successful computing-in-education project in history with over
            6 million units delivered around the world.</p>
            <p>But it's not just about the hardware! Thanks to the amazing work
            of the Raspberry Pi Foundation's education team, Python is widely
            used on the device to do all sorts of fun stuff such as program
            games (like Minecraft), travel into space (to the International
            Space Station) and control peripherals plugged into the Pi via its
            GPIO pins.</p>

            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <p>Teachers and programmers from all over the world have created
            fun, engaging and challenging resources for teachers to use in
            their classrooms. These range from simple tasks for beginners to
            advanced projects to challenge the most advanced students. They
            include lesson plans, code, books, worksheets and online
            interactive courses.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, many of these resources are free for people
            to use, adopt, adapt and contribute to.</p>

        <div id="teach-slots__community">

            <h2>Community</h2>
            <p>Community is Python's secret weapon.</p>
            <p>The Python community value openness, actively engage in outreach
            and give up their time for educational support (this site was
            written by volunteers). As one person put it, "I can for the
            programming language, but stayed for the community".</p>
            <p>The Python Software Foundation (PSF) ~ under whose auspices this
            site was created ~ support and organise conferences all over the
            world. There's a good chance there's one near you very soon.</p>
            <p>If you're looking for support, advice or just some friendly
            encouragement, get involved and say "hello".</p>

            <h2>Documentation</h2>
            <p>Python has comprehensive and excellent documentation. In fact,
            many in the Python community spend lots of effort making sure
            Python projects have comprehensive, detailed and easy to understand
            technical documentation.</p>
            <p>Need to know how to do something? Read the docs! Looking for
            the best way to use some code? Read the docs! Want to learn
            something new so you can impress your programming buddies with
            your knowledge? Read the docs!</p>

        <div id="build-slots__code">
            <img src="" alt="Contribute and re-use source code"/>
            <h2>Source Code</h2>
            <p>Python is free software: it is given away for free (nobody pays
            to use Python), you are also free to use it as you see fit and
            the Python community actively encourages people to contribute code
            for the benefit of others.</p>
            <p>For this to work you need access to the source code: the
            instructions for the computer that tell it how to do the stuff you
            want it to do.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you already know this stuff and you're just looking for
            a cool educational project to which you can contribute. If so,
            you've come to the right place!</p>
