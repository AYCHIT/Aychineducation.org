                <p>Twenty students from Rishworth School, West Yorkshire, teamed up with their ICT teacher, Peter Bell, to send their homemade space probe over 100,000 feet (about 20 miles) into the air using a helium balloon.</p>
                <p>Their probe, consisting of a micro:bit, two Raspberry Pi computers and an adorable Lego astronaut pilot took pictures of the Earth and recorded a bone-chilling minimum temperature of -47.9Â°C.</p>
